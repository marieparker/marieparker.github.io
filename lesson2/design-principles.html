                    Blogs can often feel overwhelming as the amount of information they 
                    contain can be huge. This mobile web page design keeps everything very 
                    simple. There is lots of white space around the logo and the first 
                    picture feature. Hick's Law (of eliminating options) is also applied here 
                    and gives more opportunity for white space. It is seen in red "Blog | Tutorials | 
                    Recipes" which instantly filters information 
                    for the user right from the start.

                <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>

                    The use of Fitt's Law is excellent in this mobile web site. There
                    is more to see further on down 
                    the page. But, the user lands on a view featuring a button labeled "Shop 
                    the Collection." It sits in bright orange right at the bottom of the screen 
                    where the thumb usually hovers, 
                    and spans the bottom of the screen. This makes it so 
                    easy and fast for the user to tap the link.

                <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>

                    The picture used here obviously draws your eye to the 
                    lower right third of the picture. This is where the instrument 
                    is located. The use of the rule of thirds lends a professional 
                    quality to the instrument even though it is only a picture. It instills 
                    confidence in the instrument because the photo has quality and feels 
                    professional.
