            <h3>Gardening: It's Not Just For "Old" People</h3>

            <p>My grandma was always growing something. I heard that when she was younger
                 she grew a garden, but all I remember were the flowers. There were flowers
                 all around her house outside during the summer. And flowers grew all year-round
                 in her two, yes TWO, green houses. She lived in a split level house and there was 
                 one green house on the first level off the kitchen,
                 and there was one on the second level just off her bedroom. In my memories,
                 they were always filled with flowers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've tried to grow things myself, but I have never been able to. I somehow have managed to
                kill everything I've ever tried to grow. I've consoled myself in my failure by saying, 
                "Gardening is for old people. I'll learn to do it later."
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, now it's later. And I have not magically gained a knowledge of how to keep
                plants alive. I wish I had paid more attention when I was young. I wish
                I had paid attention when Grandma talked about her flowers and how they were doing. I'm not
                even sure what pearls of plant-growing-wisdom I missed because I would just tune her out 
                when she went on about her plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, as spring gets underway, I am trying again. I've wasted years not learning how to grow
                things, so I have a pretty steep learning curve ahead of me. But, I will not be learning
                alone. My kids are out in the dirt with me, getting seeds planted and ready to go. They 
                have more faith than I that we will be able to grow these things. Everyone needs a 
                little boost of faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully, they will learn better than I did that you can't do things when you're
                old that you didn't learn first when you were young.
