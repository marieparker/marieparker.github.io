                <p>Sunshine Weather aims to help those who need sunshine, or mostly sunshine, to plan their outdoor activities. From the 
                    party planner, to the outside adventurer, to the Mom who just wants to be outside with her kids, Sunshine Weather 
                    provides a quick view into when sunshine can be expected and how long preciptation (rain or snow) will last. It also gives 
                    an overview of temperatures to help those venturing outside to plan their wardrobes ahead of time.

                <h3>Jordon - The Rock Climber</h3>
                <p>Age: 35<br>
                    Jordon checks Sunshine Weather early in his work week to plan his climbs for the weekend. He wishes to know if there 
                    will be sunshine so he can climb outside, or if he will need to plan on climbing inside due 
                    to precipitation.<br>

                <h3>Molly - The Outside-Loving Parent</h3>
                <p>Age: 27<br>
                    Molly takes her small children outside as often as she can to explore and discover. She most loves to venture out 
                    when the sun is shining, so she looks at Sunshine Weather for a quick view of the sunshine expected in the daily and weekly 
                    forecast. She also uses it to plan for what she may need to bring to take care of her small children, i.e. sunscreen,
                    raincoats, snow gear, etc...<br>
